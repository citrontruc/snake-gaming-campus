# Snake Gaming Campus

Version 1.0.0: 20250907.

## Description

Your task is to make the snake eat apples. In order to do so, place **Direction blocks** in its path to change the direction he's heading in. Choose the direction of the block to place with the **arrow keys** and place the block by **clicking on a cell** with the mouse. If you need time to place your blocks, **press space to pause / restart the game**. You have a Timer and a limited number of direction blocks. Be quick and be careful.

The game has a tutorial level in which you can practice controlling the snake. The tutorial level automatically ends when the player eats a fixed number of apples. The game goes then in endless mode.
